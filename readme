1. Append
to write append directly, you need to check two condtion 
1. if this.list is null then simply create a new node and place the value to the new node, 
2. if this.list is not null, add the value at end by while loop, and also add the next node to the null
2. Prepend
For the class method prepend:
if listHead is null then add a newnode and if it is not, 
then creat new node at the beginning and point all the other nodes to the next. 
point the nextNode to the headList and then update the lists head property to the new node

3. Size
add 1 on each iteration to const count on each iteration till the nextnode is null
