1. Append
to write append directly, you need to check two condtion 
1. if this.list is null then simply create a new node and place the value to the new node, 
2. if this.list is not null, add the value at end by while loop, and also add the next node to the null
2. Prepend
For the class method prepend:
if listHead is null then add a newnode and if it is not, 
then creat new node at the beginning and point all the other nodes to the next. 
point the nextNode to the headList and then update the lists head property to the new node

3. Size
add 1 on each iteration to const count on each iteration till the nextnode is null 

4. FindIndex 
if this.listHead is null then return null 
if index found then return that node
if index is higher than the node return "your index is bigger than the list"

5. Pop 
make two const one attached with the instance method and second as null, run a while loop with a condition if current.nextNode is not null then make both equal and give current the nextNode, after that make previous.nextNode null
6. contains
method should return true if value is found in the linked list
7. find 
run while loop if tmp is not null
add 1 at every loop to count
if tmp.value === value return count
and in the next step put tmp to the next node 
and return false overall
